Hi! So you run this by cloning the repo


### Virtual Environment, Flask, and Requests
Flask needs to be installed in order to run this program. It is ideally stored in a virtual environment (venv).

To install a venv called <name>, run these commands in your terminal:
  
```
$ pip install virtualenv
$ virtualenv <name>
  ```
  
Activate your venv
```
source <name>/bin/activate
```
  
On Mac/Linux, start up your venv with:
```
$ . <name>/bin/activate
```
On Windows: 
```
$ . <name>/Scripts/activate
  ```
  
In your activated venv, run the following:
```
$ pip install flask
$ pip install requests
```
  
Then clone the repo and move into it 
```
$ git clone https://github.com/doniatung/daliDevChallenge.git
$ cd daliDevChallenge 
```

Then run the application!
```
python app.py
```


Also! A note: I think some of the personal websites no longer exist, and also I couldn't find one of the images in the images folder (from the dali repo) for some reason
